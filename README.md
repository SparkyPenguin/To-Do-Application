# To-Do-Application
1. Assumptions - At first I wanted to go for NodeJS or DJango for the front end part of this project, but eventually chose Java for the overall development, as I had worked with Java before but had no idea about NodeJS aur DJango. However, if I had more time at hand I would have preffered working with NodeJS aur DJango.

2. Approach to my Solution - I made a rough sketch of how the To-Do list must look like, and then coded and modified it accordingly. I connected the my project to postgresql. After that, I used postgresql to create a table to store the all the values the user inputs in the To-Do list. 

3. DB Schema - I created one table with four columns - Title, Date, State, Priority. Any input given by the user gets stored here.

4. Steps to Run My Application - 
a) Run the DB.java file. If the output is "Connection Ok", that means it has successfully connected to postgresql, and we can move forward. In case the out put is "Connection Failed" then retry.
b) Now go to todo.java file and click run. The To-Do List should now appear on your screen.

The project has not been completed yet, time spent: 4-5 Hours.
